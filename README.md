# Cinefy

Cinefy is a web application that allows users to watch films and series online.
The application consists of a client and a server. The client is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The server is built with Node.js and Express.js.

## Starting the application

To start the application, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd client
```

For now open the index.html using live server or any other method.
Once the client is running, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and the application will be up and running.

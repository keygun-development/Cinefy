# Cinefy

Cinefy is a web application that allows users to watch films and series online.
The application consists of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js.

## Starting the application

To start the application, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend
```

For now open the index.html using live server or any other method.
Once the frontend is up and running, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server and the application will be up and running.
